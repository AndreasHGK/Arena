# Arena
an Arena plugin for pocketmine-mp

This plugin was originally from EmperialsPE (play.emperials.net:19132) but the Arena server will be (or has already been) shut down. The mode is based of of 'war' for Bukkit.

## Info
This plugin allows you to claim and and create and fight in arenas.

**How to use?**
To claim a piece of land, you need to grab a golden shovel and destroy pos1 and pos2 (y-axis doesn't matter). It will automaticly create the claim. Now build your arena. Do **/arena create {name} [mode]**. Now set your arena positions using **/arena pos1 {arena}** and **/arena pos2 {arena}**. The Y-axis does matter here. Now, add spawns. Do **/arena addspawn {arena} {spawnname}**. This will add a spawn where you're standing. You CAN set multiple spawns. If you have done all of this you should be able to activate your arena using **/arena activate {arena}**.

You can join arenas using **/arena join {arena}**
